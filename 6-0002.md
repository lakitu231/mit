6.0002 : Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science
===

&nbsp;
### Goals

 - Provide an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems.
 - Help students, including those who do not plan to major in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, feel confident of their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals.
 - Position students so that they can compete for research projects and excel in subjects with programming components.

### Notes

**Computational Models**
 - Experimental devices that help us to understand something that has happened or to predict the future
 - Optimization models
    - an objective function that is to be maximized or minimized
    - a set of constraints that must be honorer
 - Statistical models
 - Simulation models

**Algorithm : Optimization - *knapsack problem***

 - Brute Force Algorithm
    > enumerate all possible combination of items : the *power set*; remove all the combinations which total units exceeds the allowed weight; choose any one from the remaining combinations which value is the largest

- Greedy Algorithm
    > while knapsack not full: put "best" available item in knapsack
    > only results in a local optima

- Search Tree Algorithm
   > the first element is selected from the still to be considered items; if there is room for that item in the knapsack, a node is constructed that reflects the consequence of choosing to take that item; also explore the consequences of not taking that item.  
   > the process is then applied recursively to non-leaf children; choose a node with the highest value that meets constraints
    
    
**Dynamic Programming**
 - memoization : create a table to record what has been done
 - optimal substructure : a globally optimal solution can be found by combining optimal solutions to local subproblems
 - overlapping subproblems : finding an optimal solution involves solving the same problem multiple times


**Graph**
 - consists of :
    - set of nodes (vertices) : might have properties associated with them
    - set of edges (arcs) each consisting of a pair of nodes
       - undirected (graph)
       - directed (digraph) : source (parent) and destination (child) nodes
       - unweighted or weighted
 - implementation :
    - building graphs : nodes, edges, stitching together to make graphs
    - using graphs : searching for paths between nodes, searching for optimal paths between nodes
 - common representation :
    - adjacency matrix
    - adjacency list : associate with each node a list of destination nodes
   

**Algorithm : Shortest Path**
 - Depth First Search (DFS)
    - start at an initial node
    - consider all edges that leave the node, in some order
    - follow the first edge, and check to see if at goal node
    - if not, repeat the process for new node
    - continue until either find goal node, or run out of options
    - when run out of options, backtrack to the previous node and try the next edge, repeating this process
 
 - Breadth First Search (BFS)
    - start at an initial node
    - consider all edges that leave the node, in some order
    - follow the first edge, and check to see if at goal node
    - if not, try the next edge from the current node
    - continue until either find goal node, or run out of options
    - when run out of edge options, move to next node at same distance from start, and repeat
    - when run out of node options, move to the next level in the graph, and repeat
