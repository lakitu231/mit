6.0001 : Introduction to Computer Science Programming in Python
===

&nbsp;
### Goals

 - Provide an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems.
 - Help students, including those who do not plan to major in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, feel confident of their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals.
 - Position students so that they can compete for research projects and excel in subjects with programming components.

&nbsp;
### Key Topics

 - represent knowledge with **data structures**
 - **iteration and recursion** as computational metaphors
 - **abstraction** of procedures and data types
 - **organize and modularize** systems using object classes and methods
 - different classes of **algorithms**, searching and sorting
 - **complexity** of algorithms
 
&nbsp;
 - **Computational Thinking**
   - Abstraction : operate in multiple layers of abstractions simultaneously
   - Automation : think in terms of mechanizing our abstractions
   - Algorithms : language for describing automated processes and communicating ideas

### Notes

**Types of Knowledge**

 - Declarative : stating a fact
 - Imperative


**Components of Algorithms**

 - sequence of steps
 - flow of control : decicions, repetitions
 - a way to stop


**Basic Machine Architecture**

 - Memory : contains data & sequence of instructions
 - ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) : do basic operations
 - Control Unit : contains program counter
 - Input / Output 


**Algorithms : f(x) = y**

 - Guess and Check (Exhaustive Enumeration)
    > Only returns exact solution.  
    > Loops until a solution is found or until all reasonable guesses are exhausted.  
 - Approximate Solutions
    > Start with a guess and increment that guess by a small value until a good enough solution is found.  
    > Keep guessing until the f(x) is close enough to y, by range of epsilon.  
 - Bisection Search
    > Eliminate half of the search space with every guesses -- half interval each iteration.  
    > Guess is the average of low and high.  
    > Convergence is log_2(N)  


**Functions**
 - Mechanisms to achieve decomposition and abstraction
 - Decomposition : divide code into modules (achieved wtith functions and classes)
 - Abstraction : a piece of code as a black box (achieved with function specifications or docstrings)
 

**Variable Scope / Environment**
 - Formal Parameter gets bound to the value of Actual Parameter when function is called.


**Compound Data Types**
 - Tuples
    - Immutable
    - Usage : variables swapping, returning multiple values from a function
 - Lists
    - Mutable
    - Aliasing : can have multiple variables point to the same object
 - Dictionaries
    - Pairs keys and values
    - Key can be any immutable type
    - No guaranteed order


**Recursion**
 - Taking a problem and reducing it to a smaller version of the same problem
 - Base Case : keep reducing problem until reach a simple case that can be solved directly
 - Each recursive call to a function creates its own scope / environment


**Overcoming Bugs**
 - Defensive programming
    - write specifications
    - modularize program : break program up into modules that can be tested and debugged individually
    - check conditions on input/output

**Classes Test**
 - Unit testing : validate each piece of program
 - Regression testing : add test for bugs as you find them
 - Integration testing : test overall program

**Testing**
 - Black Box Testing : explore paths through specification
 - Glass Box Testing : explore paths through code
 - called path-complete if every potential path through code is tested at least once

**Class Attributes**
 - data attributes : other objects that make up the class
 - procedural attributes (methods) : functions to interact with the object
 - class variables : shared between all instances of class, set in the definition of class

**O() - Big 'O' Notation**
 - measures an upper bound on the asymptotic growth, often called order of growth
 
**Complexity Classes**
 - O(1) : constant - code does not depend on size of problem
 - O(log n) : logarithmic - reduce problem in half each time through process
 - O(n) : linear - simple iterative or recursive programs
 - O(n log n) : loglinear
 - O(n^c) : polynomial - nested loops or recursive calls
 - O(c^n) : exponential - multiple recursive calls at each level

**Algorithms : Search**
 - Linear Search
   > brute force search, list does not have to be sorted
   > overall complexity is O(n)
   
 - Bisection Search
   > list must be sorted
   > overall complexity is O(log n)
   
**Algorithms : Sort**
 - Bubble Sort
   > compare consecutive pairs of elements, swap elements in pair such that smaller is first, start over when reach end of list, stop when no more swaps has been made
   > overall complexity is O(n^2)
   
 - Selection Sort
   > extract minimum element, swap it with element at index 0, extract minimum element in the remaining sublist, swap it with the element at index 1
   > keep the left portion of the list sorted. at i'th step, first i elements in list are sorted, all other elements are bigger than first i elements
   > overall complexity is O(n^2)

 - Merge Sort
   > if list is of length 0 or 1, already sorted
   > if list has more than one element, split into two lists and sort each
   > merge sorted sublists : look at first element of each, move smaller to end of the result. when one list empty, copy rest of other list to end of result
   > overall complexity is O(n log n)
