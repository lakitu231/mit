6.0001 : Introduction to Computer Science Programming in Python
===

&nbsp;
### Goals

 - Provide an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems.
 - Help students, including those who do not plan to major in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, feel confident of their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals.
 - Position students so that they can compete for research projects and excel in subjects with programming components.

### Notes

**Types of Knowledge**

 - Declarative : stating a fact
 - Imperative


**Components of Algorithms**

 - sequence of steps
 - flow of control : decicions, repetitions
 - a way to stop


**Basic Machine Architecture**

 - Memory : contains data & sequence of instructions
 - ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) : do basic operations
 - Control Unit : contains program counter
 - Input / Output 


**Algorithms : f(x) = y**

 - Guess and Check (Exhaustive Enumeration)
    > Only returns exact solution.  
    > Loops until a solution is found or until all reasonable guesses are exhausted.  
 - Approximate Solutions
    > Start with a guess and increment that guess by a small value until a good enough solution is found.  
    > Keep guessing until the f(x) is close enough to y, by range of epsilon.  
 - Bisection Search
    > Eliminate half of the search space with every guesses -- half interval each iteration.  
    > Guess is the average of low and high.  
    > Convergence is log_2(N)  


**Functions**
 - Mechanisms to achieve decomposition and abstraction
 - Decomposition : divide code into modules (achieved wtith functions and classes)
 - Abstraction : a piece of code as a black box (achieved with function specifications or docstrings)
 

**Variable Scope / Environment**
 - Formal Parameter gets bound to the value of Actual Parameter when function is called.
